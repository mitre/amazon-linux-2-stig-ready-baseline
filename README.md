# amazon-linux-2-stig-ready-baseline

InSpec profile to validate the secure configuration of Amazon Linux 2 against STIG-ready content.

## Getting Started  
It is intended and recommended that InSpec and this profile be run from a __"runner"__ host (such as a DevOps orchestration server, an administrative management system, or a developer's workstation/laptop) against the target remotely over __ssh__.

__For the best security of the runner, always install on the runner the _latest version_ of InSpec and supporting Ruby language components.__ 

Latest versions and installation options are available at the [InSpec](http://inspec.io/) site.

### Sudo Password

The hardening configures the system to require a sudo password.  You should set the sudo password you want via an Environment Variable as `SUDO_PASSWD` to test-kitchen can set it correctly. 

The default is set to 'P@ssw0rd!' ***WHICH YOU NEED TO UPDATE***.

The GitHub Actions Set the sudo password they use via a shared secret.

## Tailoring to Your Environment

The following inputs may be configured in an inputs ".yml" file for the profile to run correctly for your specific environment. More information about InSpec inputs can be found in the [InSpec Profile Documentation](https://www.inspec.io/docs/reference/profiles/).

## Long Running Controls

There are a few long running controls that take anywhere from 3 minutes to 10 minutes or more to run. In an ongoing or CI/CD pipelne this may not be ideal. We have supplied an 
input (mentioned above in the user-defined inputs) in the profile to allow you to 'skip' these controls to account for these situations.

The input `disable_slow_controls (bool: false)` can be set to `true` or `false` as needed in a <name_of_your_input_file>.yml file.

## Running This Profile Directly from Github

Against a remote target using ssh with escalated privileges (i.e., InSpec installed on a separate runner host)
```bash
# How to run 
inspec exec https://github.com/mitre/amazon-linux-2-stig-ready-baseline/archive/main.tar.gz -t ssh://TARGET_USERNAME:TARGET_PASSWORD@TARGET_IP:TARGET_PORT --sudo --sudo-password=<SUDO_PASSWORD_IF_REQUIRED> --input-file <path_to_your_input_file/name_of_your_input_file.yml> --reporter=cli json:<path_to_your_output_file/name_of_your_output_file.json> 
```

Against a remote target using a pem key with escalated privileges (i.e., InSpec installed on a separate runner host)
```bash
# How to run 
inspec exec https://github.com/mitre/amazon-linux-2-stig-ready-baseline/archive/main.tar.gz -t ssh://TARGET_USERNAME@TARGET_IP:TARGET_PORT --sudo -i <your_PEM_KEY> --input-file <path_to_your_input_file/name_of_your_input_file.yml> --reporter=cli json:<path_to_your_output_file/name_of_your_output_file.json>  
```

Against a local Red Hat host with escalated privileges (i.e., InSpec installed on the target)
```bash
# How to run
sudo inspec exec https://github.com/mitre/amazon-linux-2-stig-ready-baseline/archive/main.tar.gz --input-file <path_to_your_input_file/name_of_your_input_file.yml> --reporter=cli json:<path_to_your_output_file/name_of_your_output_file.json> 
```
### Different Run Options

  [Full exec options](https://docs.chef.io/inspec/cli/#options-3)

## Running This Baseline from a local Archive copy
If your runner is not always expected to have direct access to GitHub, use the following steps to create an archive bundle of this profile and all of its dependent tests:

(Git is required to clone the InSpec profile using the instructions below. Git can be downloaded from the [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) site.) 

```
mkdir profiles
cd profiles
git clone https://github.com/mitre/amazon-linux-2-stig-ready-baseline.git
inspec archive amazon-linux-2-stig-ready-baseline
sudo inspec exec <name of generated archive> --input-file <path_to_your_input_file/name_of_your_input_file.yml> --reporter=cli json:<path_to_your_output_file/name_of_your_output_file.json> 
```

For every successive run, follow these steps to always have the latest version of this baseline and dependent profiles:

```
cd amazon-linux-2-stig-ready-baseline
git pull
cd ..
inspec archive amazon-linux-2-stig-ready-baseline --overwrite
sudo inspec exec <name of generated archive> --input-file <path_to_your_input_file/name_of_your_input_file.yml> --reporter=cli json:<path_to_your_output_file/name_of_your_output_file.json> 
```

## Using Heimdall for Viewing the JSON Results

![Heimdall Lite 2.0 Demo GIF](https://github.com/mitre/heimdall2/blob/master/apps/frontend/public/heimdall-lite-2.0-demo-5fps.gif)

The JSON results output file can be loaded into __[heimdall-lite](https://heimdall-lite.mitre.org/)__ for a user-interactive, graphical view of the InSpec results. 

The JSON InSpec results file may also be loaded into a __[full heimdall server](https://github.com/mitre/heimdall)__, allowing for additional functionality such as to store and compare multiple profile runs.
