Changes to operating system configurations can have unintended side effects, some of which may be relevant to security.\n\nDetecting such changes and providing an automated response can help avoid unintended, negative consequences that could ultimately affect the security state of the operating system. The operating system's Information System Security Manager (ISSM)/Information System Security Officer (ISSO) and System Administrators (SAs) must be notified via email and/or monitoring system trap when there is an unauthorized modification of a configuration item.\"\n  desc 'check', 'Verify the operating system notifies designated personnel if baseline configurations are changed in an unauthorized manner.\n\nNote: A file integrity tool other than Advanced Intrusion Detection Environment (AIDE) may be used, but the tool must be executed and notify specified individuals via email or an alert.\n\nCheck for the presence of a cron job running routinely on the system that executes AIDE to scan for changes to the system baseline. The commands used in the example will use a daily occurrence.\n\nCheck the cron directories for a \"crontab\" script file controlling the execution of the file integrity application. For example, if AIDE is installed on the system, use the following command:\n\n     # ls -al /etc/cron.* | grep aide\n     -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 602 Mar 6 20:02 aide\n\n     # grep aide /etc/crontab /var/spool/cron/root\n     /etc/crontab: 30 04 * * * root /usr/sbin/aide  --check\n     /var/spool/cron/root: 30 04 * * * /usr/sbin/aide  --check\n\nAIDE does not have a configuration that will send a notification, so the cron job uses the mail application on the system to email the results of the file integrity run as in the following example:\n\n     # more /etc/cron.daily/aide\n     #!/bin/bash\n\n     /usr/sbin/aide --check | /var/spool/mail -s \"$HOSTNAME - Daily aide integrity check run\" root@sysname.mil\n\nIf the file integrity application does not notify designated personnel of changes, this is a finding.'\n  desc 'fix', 'Configure the operating system to notify designated personnel if baseline configurations are changed in an unauthorized manner. The AIDE tool can be configured to email designated personnel with the use of the cron system.\n\nThe following example output is generic. It will set cron to run AIDE daily and to send email at the completion of the analysis.\n\n     # more /etc/cron.daily/aide\n\n     /usr/sbin/aide --check | /var/spool/mail -s \"$HOSTNAME - Daily aide integrity check run\" root@sysname.mil'\n  impact 0.5\n  tag severity: 'medium'\n  tag gtitle: 'SRG-OS-000363-GPOS-00150'\n  tag stig_id: 'AMZL-02-720040'\n  tag cci: ['CCI-001744']\n  tag nist: ['CM-3 (5)']\n  tag subsystems: ['file_integrity_tool']\n  tag 'host'\n  tag 'container'\n\n  file_integrity_tool = input('file_integrity_tool')\n\n  describe.one do\n    describe file(\"/etc/cron.daily/#{file_integrity_tool}\") do\n      its('content') { should match %r{/var/spool/mail} }\n    end\n    describe file(\"/etc/cron.weekly/#{file_integrity_tool}\") do\n      its('content') { should match %r{/var/spool/mail} }\n    end\n    describe crontab('root').where {\n               command =~ /#{file_integrity_tool}/\n             } do\n      its('commands.flatten') { should include(match %r{/var/spool/mail}) }\n    end\n    if file(\"/etc/cron.d/#{file_integrity_tool}\").exist?\n      describe crontab(path: \"/etc/cron.d/#{file_integrity_tool}\") do\n        its('commands') { should include(match %r{/var/spool/mail}) }\n      end\n    end\n  end\nend\n","source_location":{"line":1,"ref":"./controls/AMZL-02-720040.rb"},"waiver_data":{},"results":[{"status":"failed","code_desc":"File /etc/cron.daily/aide content is expected to match /\\/var\\/spool\\/mail/","run_time":0.000795,"start_time":"2023-11-27T23:36:37-05:00","message":"expected nil to match /\\/var\\/spool\\/mail/","exception":"RSpec::Core::MultipleExceptionError","resource_class":"file","resource_params":"[\"/etc/cron.daily/aide\"]","resource_id":"/etc/cron.daily/aide"},{"status":"failed","code_desc":"File /etc/cron.weekly/aide content is expected to match /\\/var\\/spool\\/mail/","run_time":0.000335,"start_time":"2023-11-27T23:36:37-05:00","message":"expected nil to match /\\/var\\/spool\\/mail/","exception":"RSpec::Core::MultipleExceptionError","resource_class":"file","resource_params":"[\"/etc/cron.weekly/aide\"]","resource_id":"/etc/cron.weekly/aide"},{"status":"failed","code_desc":"crontab for user root with command =~ /aide/ commands.flatten is expected to include (match /\\/var\\/spool\\/mail/)","run_time":0.003897,"start_time":"2023-11-27T23:36:37-05:00","message":"expected [\"/usr/sbin/aide  --check | /bin/mail -s \\\"$(hostname) - AIDE Integrity Check\\\" root@localhost\"] to include (match /\\/var\\/spool\\/mail/)\nDiff:\n@@ -1 +1 @@\n-[(match /\\/var\\/spool\\/mail/)]\n+[\"/usr/sbin/aide  --check | /bin/mail -s \\\"$(hostname) - AIDE Integrity Check\\\" root@localhost\"]\n","exception":"RSpec::Core::MultipleExceptionError","resource_class":"FilterTable::Table","resource_params":"[]","resource_id":""}],"status":"failed"},{"id":"AMZL-02-720050","title":"The Amazon Linux 2 operating system must prevent the installation of software, patches, service\n    packs, device drivers, or operating system components from a repository without verification they have been\n    digitally signed using a certificate that is issued by a Certificate Authority (CA) that is recognized and approved\n    by the organization.","desc":"Changes to any software components can have significant effects on the overall security of the operating\n    system.
